## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ian and Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at Arizona State University. I want to become a game developer one day, so Iâ€™m continuously trying to learn how to make great games. I specialize in Unity as of now, but Iâ€™m trying to expand my knowledge into more engines whenever I find free time to do so.
